8-Puzzle game problem and solution solved with three different search algorithms: BFS, DFS and A*.

To execute this code type this:

python3 driver_3.py <method> <board>

<method>: bfs, dfs & ast
<board>: 0,1,2,4,3,5,6,7,8

Results will be shown on the output.txt file in the form of:

path_to_goal:
cost_of_path:
nodes_expanded: 
search_depth: 
max_search_depth: 
running_time: 
max_ram_usage:
